# Ada Software Internship Project

## Introduction

This project was created as part of my internship at Ada Software Company. It is a comprehensive application with both frontend and backend components that uses REST API services to provide a unified experience for managing police records. The primary goal of the project is to develop a user-friendly platform that allows users to easily log in, view, add, and delete police records.

## Features

- User Authentication: The application allows users to log in securely using their credentials.
- Police Record Management: Users can view a list of police records, add new records, and delete existing records.
- .NET MAUI: The frontend is developed using .NET MAUI, a multi-platform UI framework for creating cross-platform apps.
- ASP.NET Web API: The backend is powered by ASP.NET Web API to handle API requests and manage data.
- EF Core & Migrations: Entity Framework Core is used for database interactions, and migrations ensure the database schema stays updated.
- MVVM Architecture: The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern for separation of concerns.
- HTTP Client: The frontend communicates with the backend using HTTP requests and responses.
- SecureStorage: User authentication tokens and sensitive information are securely stored using the SecureStorage feature.
- Navigation: The application utilizes navigation to move between different screens and functionalities.
- DataBinding: DataBinding is used to establish a connection between the UI elements and the underlying data.
- Dependency Injection: Dependency Injection is employed to manage the application's dependencies and promote modularity.
